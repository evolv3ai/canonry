# Canonry Roadmap

## Current State

Canonry is a fully functional agent-first open-source AEO operating platform with the following capabilities:

- **Multi-provider visibility runs**: Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and local LLM (OpenAI-compatible API)
- **CLI / API / UI surface parity**: Every feature accessible through all three surfaces
- **Config-as-code**: `canonry.yaml` with `canonry apply` / `canonry export`
- **Scheduling**: Cron-based with presets (daily, weekly, twice-daily, custom), timezone support, catch-up on missed runs
- **Webhooks**: HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads, events: `citation.lost`, `citation.gained`, `run.completed`, `run.failed`
- **Auto-generate keywords**: LLM-powered keyword generation per project
- **Multi-project support**: Full CRUD with multi-project dashboard
- **Usage counters**: Per-provider daily quotas enforced in job runner
- **Audit logging**: All config mutations tracked with diffs
- **Snapshot history**: Timeline with computed transitions, run diffs, per-provider breakdowns
- **Project-scoped location-aware runs**: Named project locations, default location selection, explicit per-run overrides, all-location sweeps, and location-filtered history
- **Auth**: API key auth with scopes, same path local and cloud
- **OpenAPI spec**: Auto-generated at `/api/v1/openapi.json`
- **SQLite**: Local-first with Drizzle ORM and auto-migration

Published as `@ainyc/canonry` on npm.

## Market Position

Canonry sits in the AEO observability and optimization category. The market today is split across three shapes:

| Category | Typical pricing | Typical strengths | Typical limits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hosted paid AEO observability tools | $250–$1000+/mo | AEO content scoring, prompt volumes, enterprise SOV, daily snapshots | Closed source, per-prompt or per-seat pricing, no data ownership, single-perspective queries from cloud DCs |
| AEO add-ons inside large SEO suites | bundled in SEO seats | BI-tool integration, per-platform add-ons, established UX | Tied to suite pricing/lock-in; AEO is a secondary feature |
| Free brand-positioning graders | $0 | Awareness / lead-gen entry point | Brand positioning only; no deep tracking |

**Canonry's structural advantages**: open-source, local-first, API-first, config-as-code, no vendor lock-in, no per-prompt pricing, full data ownership. Where incumbents observe from one cloud perspective, canonry's local-first architecture enables a distributed sensing network capturing localized, audience-specific perspectives (see [ADR 0005](adr/0005-distributed-node-hub-architecture.md)).

## Phase 2.5: Core Metrics (Quick Wins)

These build on existing infrastructure with minimal schema/architecture changes.

### Citation Position & Prominence Tracking
**Gap**: Canonry records binary `cited`/`not-cited`. Hosted incumbents track "prominence" (where in the answer your brand appears) and citation ordering.
**Implementation**: When normalizing provider results, record the *index* of your domain in `groundingSources[]` and whether the domain appears in the first paragraph of `answerText`. Add `citationPosition` (int, nullable) and `prominenceScore` (float 0-1) to `querySnapshots`.
**Impact**: Transforms flat binary tracking into ranked visibility — "you're cited, but dropping from position 1 to position 4."

### Share of Voice (SOV) Metrics
**Gap**: Every paid AEO incumbent offers SOV. Canonry doesn't compute it.
**Implementation**: SOV = (runs where cited / total runs) as a percentage, computed per keyword and aggregated per project. Pure query-time computation over existing `querySnapshots` data — no schema changes needed. Add `GET /api/v1/projects/:name/sov` endpoint. Show on dashboard as a primary metric gauge.
**Impact**: The single most-requested AEO metric. Makes Canonry dashboards immediately comparable to paid tools.

### Sentiment Classification of Mentions
**Gap**: Hosted incumbents classify mentions as positive/neutral/negative. Canonry stores `answerText` but doesn't analyze tone.
**Implementation**: Use a cheap model (Haiku/GPT-4o-mini) to classify sentiment of how the domain is mentioned. Add `sentimentTone` ('positive'|'neutral'|'negative') and `sentimentSnippet` (the relevant excerpt) to `querySnapshots`. Run as a post-processing step after the main query.
**Impact**: Distinguishes "Brand X is the industry leader" from "Brand X has been criticized for..."

### Competitor Share-of-Voice Comparison
**Gap**: Canonry tracks `competitorOverlap` (which competitors appear) but doesn't compute comparative SOV.
**Implementation**: Extend the SOV endpoint to return SOV for each competitor alongside your domain. Render as a stacked bar chart or comparison table on the dashboard.
**Impact**: Answers "who's winning the AI answer war for this keyword?"

### Results CSV/JSON Export
**Gap**: Some paid incumbents highlight CSV export as a key feature. Canonry's `canonry export` exports config YAML, not results data.
**Implementation**: Add `canonry export <project> --format csv --include-results` that exports snapshot data as CSV. Add corresponding `GET /api/v1/projects/:name/export?format=csv&include=results` endpoint.
**Impact**: Enables BI tool integration (Excel, Looker Studio, Tableau) without API coding.

---

## Phase 3: Deeper Analysis & New Providers

### Site Audit + Technical Readiness Score
**Existing asset**: `@ainyc/aeo-audit` (v1.2.2, published on npm, MIT) already scores websites across 13 weighted factors: structured data, content depth, AI-readable content, E-E-A-T signals, FAQ content, citations/authority, schema completeness, entity consistency, content freshness, extractability, definition blocks, named entities, AI crawler access (+ optional geo signals). Programmatic API: `runAeoAudit(url, opts) -> report`.
**Implementation**: Import `@ainyc/aeo-audit` as a dependency in `packages/canonry`. Wire into a new `site-audit` run kind: `POST /api/v1/projects/:name/runs` with `kind: 'site-audit'`. Store audit results in a new `auditSnapshots` table. Add `canonry audit <project>` CLI command. Show Technical Readiness score as a second gauge on the project dashboard alongside Answer Visibility.
**Impact**: Completes the "monitor + optimize" loop. Two score families give Canonry a unique dual-lens view.

### Perplexity Provider
**Gap**: Paid incumbents track 5+ engines. Perplexity is the #2 most-requested engine after ChatGPT.
**Implementation**: New `packages/provider-perplexity/` adapter using Perplexity's OpenAI-compatible API with `web_search` focus. Minimal work given existing OpenAI adapter as template.
**Impact**: Engine coverage from 3 to 4+ puts Canonry ahead of most mid-market tools.

### Answer Snapshots & Diff Viewer
**Gap**: No tool shows exactly *how* AI answers changed over time for the same query.
**Implementation**: Canonry already stores `answerText`. Build a side-by-side diff view in the UI comparing answer text across runs for the same keyword. Highlight added/removed citations and text changes.
**Impact**: Unique feature — paid incumbents don't show full answer diffs.

### Prompt-to-Topic Clustering
**Gap**: Hosted incumbents offer "prompt-level analytics" grouping queries by topic.
**Implementation**: Use an LLM call to cluster keywords into topic groups (e.g., "pricing", "comparison", "how-to"). Store topic assignments in a new `keywordTopics` table. Aggregate SOV and sentiment by topic on the dashboard.
**Impact**: Analysts think by topic, not keyword-by-keyword. This is how hosted incumbents justify their high SaaS pricing tiers.

### Citation-Driven Content Opportunities + Action Outcome Ledger (LEAD WAVE-0 INVESTMENT)
**Gap**: An "AEO Content Score" is the most differentiated feature offered by hosted incumbents. No open-source tool offers an action-typed, deterministic recommendation engine paired with closed-loop outcome tracking.
**Implementation**: See `docs/gtm.md` §3a for the full product spec and `docs/adr/0009-content-action-outcome-ledger-and-publish-boundary.md` for the architectural contract. Canonical artifacts:
- `canonry content targets` — ranked, action-typed (`create | expand | refresh | add-schema`) opportunity list with deterministic AEO-first classifier and additive two-branch scorer (`demand_score + competitor_score`) so zero-GSC `create` opportunities still rank.
- `canonry content brief` — JSON-canonical structured brief with explicit `evidenceLedger`, `knownFields`, `unknownFields[]` (the load-bearing anti-hallucination guarantee).
- `canonry content publish-payload` — pure CMS-shaped payload generation (no mutation); pluggable transformers for WordPress, Ghost, Next.js MDX, generic. Other CMSes via transformer payload + agent-executed HTTP.
- `canonry wordpress create-draft` — the one full CMS mutation (WP only, audit-logged). All other publishing executed by agent with its own credentials.
- **`content_actions` ledger** — every recommended action becomes a tracked experiment with baseline + lifecycle states (`briefed → payload-generated → published → validated`, plus `dismissed`) + computed outcome (`improved | unchanged | regressed | inconclusive`). Foundation for future per-domain ranker learning.
- **Drafting deliberately out of scope** for canonry — external agents (Claude Code, Codex, Aero) write the prose from brief + their own URL retrieval.
**Impact**: Closes the loop from observation → action → measurement. Generates the training data for "did `add-schema` work better than `expand` for this site?" — the foundation for outcome-weighted ranking, no ML required in v1. Most differentiated content surface in the open-source AEO category.

### Claude Code Skill
**Gap**: AI agents need a way to interact with Canonry data.
**Implementation**: Ship a Claude Code skill (like `@ainyc/aeo-audit`'s `/aeo` skill) that wraps the Canonry CLI/API. Modes: `status`, `run`, `evidence`, `audit`. The skill calls the local CLI or API under the hood.
**Impact**: AI agents get natural-language access to Canonry through existing surfaces.

### Crawl Health Monitoring
**Gap**: Hosted incumbents track AI crawler frequency. Sites that block AI crawlers get worse citations.
**Existing asset**: `@ainyc/aeo-audit` already checks per-bot `robots.txt` rules for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot as its "AI Crawler Access" factor.
**Implementation**: Run a single-factor audit (`runAeoAudit(url, { factors: ['ai-crawler-access'] })`) or add a dedicated `GET /api/v1/projects/:name/crawl-health` endpoint.
**Impact**: Answers "can AI engines even access my content?" Near-zero new code thanks to `aeo-audit`.

### Anomaly Detection & Smart Alerts
**Gap**: Hosted incumbents offer "anomaly detection." Current Canonry webhooks fire on every citation change.
**Implementation**: Track rolling SOV averages. Alert only when SOV drops/spikes beyond a configurable threshold. Add alert rules: `citation.anomaly`, `sov.drop`, `sov.spike`.
**Impact**: Reduces alert noise. Analysts get signal, not every fluctuation.

## Phase 2.7: Distributed Node Architecture

See [ADR 0005](adr/0005-distributed-node-hub-architecture.md) for full rationale.

Cloud SaaS AEO tools query from data centers, producing a single decontextualized perspective. As LLM search becomes hyper-localized and personalized, this gap becomes a structural blind spot. Canonry's local-first architecture enables a distributed sensing network where each installation captures the real, localized, audience-specific perspective — something no cloud-only tool can replicate.

### Node Identity & Context Metadata
**Gap**: Snapshots have no origin context. When multiple Canonry instances exist, there's no way to distinguish or aggregate their data.
**Implementation**: Add `nodeId`, `nodeLocation`, `nodeContext` columns to `querySnapshots`. Node identity configured via env vars or `canonry.yaml`. Defaults to `'local'` for backward compatibility.
**Impact**: Foundation for all multi-node features. Zero UX change for single-node users.

### Persona-Framed Queries
**Gap**: Analysts capture their own personalized perspective, not their target audience's. A 28-year-old SEO professional gets different LLM answers than a 35-year-old homeowner.
**Implementation**: New `personas` table per project. Each persona defines a `systemInstruction` (passed as system message to Gemini/OpenAI/Claude APIs) with query text modification as fallback. Job runner fans out across personas: `keyword × provider × persona`. Add `personaId` to snapshots. Config-as-code support in `canonry.yaml`. Surface parity: CLI (`canonry persona add`), API (`POST /api/v1/projects/:name/personas`), and UI (persona management + filter).
**Impact**: Enables audience-segmented AEO monitoring using existing API providers — no new infrastructure. "Homeowners see us cited, property managers don't" becomes a trackable metric.

### Browser Provider (ChatGPT UI)
**Gap**: API-based queries (`web_search_preview`) return different results than the real ChatGPT UI. The UI reflects logged-in user context, conversation history, and real personalization.
**Implementation**: New `packages/provider-chatgpt-browser/` adapter. Chrome MCP integration first (leverages existing MCP ecosystem), CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) as fallback. Implements standard `ProviderAdapter` interface. Navigates to ChatGPT, submits query, extracts answer text + cited sources from DOM.
**Impact**: Highest-signal provider. Captures what real users actually see. Combined with personas and node identity, creates a multi-dimensional observation matrix.

### Hub Sync Protocol
**Gap**: Multiple Canonry nodes have no way to share data or aggregate insights across locations.
**Implementation**: Hub mode via `canonry serve --mode hub` (same binary). Nodes push snapshots to hub on run completion (auto-sync) or manually (`canonry sync`). Hub pushes config to nodes. Append-only, cursor-based sync. Nodes are authoritative for their snapshots; hub is authoritative for config. Configurable sync scope: normalized summary by default, opt-in to full raw responses.
**Impact**: Enables cross-location analytics. Agency with nodes in Portland and Seattle can compare citation variance. Hub also runs API-based baseline queries as a non-personalized control group.

### Cross-Node & Cross-Persona Analytics
**Gap**: No tool offers geographic citation heatmaps or audience-segmented SOV.
**Implementation**: New hub-side API endpoints: citation consistency, localization delta, geographic heatmap, audience SOV. Dashboard additions: heatmap view, consistency gauge, persona variance charts, per-node run breakdowns.
**Impact**: Metrics that are structurally impossible for cloud SaaS tools: "Cited in 80% of local queries but 30% of generic queries" and "Strong with homeowners, invisible to property managers."

## Phase 4: Long-Term Initiatives

### Google AI Overviews Provider
Requires SerpAPI or similar to scrape Google search results with AI Overview snippets. "Bring your own SerpAPI key" approach.

### Real User Panel
Lightweight browser extension that real users opt into. Passively observes AI search interactions, anonymizes data, and reports citations back to the hub. The "Nielsen ratings for AI search" model — captures actual personalized results without simulation.

### Synthetic Browser Profiles
Multiple Chrome profiles with different ChatGPT custom instructions, browsing history, and cookies. Canonry rotates through them for deeper persona simulation beyond query framing.

### Historical Trend Analytics & Forecasting
Time-series analytics over SOV, sentiment, and citation position. 7/30/90-day trends. Moving averages and linear regression for SOV projections.

### Multi-Tenant Cloud Mode
Postgres mode, team workspaces, API key scoping per team, Stripe billing integration. Hub mode provides the foundation.

### Integrations Ecosystem
Slack (alerts), Google Sheets (export), Looker Studio (data source), Zapier/n8n (webhook docs), Google Search Console (correlate organic vs. AI visibility).

### Agency/Multi-Brand Management
Project grouping ("workspaces" or "organizations"), cross-project dashboards, templated configs for agency workflows. Builds on hub + multi-node architecture.
